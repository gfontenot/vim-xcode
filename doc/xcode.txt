ABOUT (1)                                                          *xcode-About*

`xcode.vim` is primarily a thin wrapper around Apple's `xcodebuild` command
line application that lets you build and test your Xcode projects from within
Vim. It dynamically figures out your project information and passes the proper
flags to `xcodebuild`.

If you have `xcpretty`[1] installed, `xcode.vim` will use it to reformat
the output from `xcodebuild`.

This plugin was written by Gordon Fontenot[2]. Bugs and feature requests are
welcomed, and can be posted on the GitHub repo[3].

USAGE (2)                                                          *xcode-Usage*

`xcode.vim` provides two main commands, one for building the project, and one
for testing the project. It dynamically looks at your project configuration
and determines which flags to pass to `xcodebuild`.

Currently, `xcode.vim` only looks at the first scheme that it finds in the
Xcode project file in the working directory. It uses the build settings in
that scheme to determine which SDK to test against. If you have an Xcode
workspace file that contains your project (as is common with projects using
CocoaPods[4]), it will build the scheme through the workspace.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 *xcode-:Xbuild*
2.1 :Xbuild~

Build the project with `xcodebuild`.

The first time this command is run, there will be a small delay as the plugin
parses the scheme information from the project. This scheme info is cached
with your Vim session, so subsequent runs will execute faster.

You can also optionally pass build actions to |:Xbuild| if you'd like to
override the default of `build`. This could be used, for example, to run
`xcodebuild clean build` if you wanted to clean before building.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                   *xcode-:Xrun*
2.2 :Xrun

Build and run the app in the iOS simulator or locally on your Mac.

You can also optionally pass a simulator name to |:Xrun| if you'd like to
override the default for this specific session.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  *xcode-:Xtest*
2.3 :Xtest~

Run the project tests through `xcodebuild`.

The first time this command is run, there will be a small delay as the plugin
parses the SDK information for the scheme, and might be a delay while it
parses the scheme information as well (if |:Xbuild| hasn't been run
previously). This information is cached with the Vim session, so subsequent
runs will execute faster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 *xcode-:Xclean*
2.4 :Xclean~

Clean the project's build directory with `xcodebuild`

This is useful for debugging build errors. Sometimes Xcode doesn't behave, and
grabs stale build objects. Cleaning the project's build directory can
occasionally solve these issues.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  *xcode-:Xopen*
2.5 :Xopen~

Open the project or a specified file in Xcode

There are still some things that aren't able to be done in Vim. Things like
modifying the project index, changing build settings, and working with
Interface Builder are better done in Xcode. This command provides an easy way
to open the project quickly.

You can also pass an optional file path to this command in order to open that
file in Xcode. This can be useful for doing things like debugging a tricky
class with the help of Xcode's faster feedback loop, or modifying an interface
file.

Xcode itself is fairly smart about this, too. If you open a specific file
while you have the project itself open, Xcode will actually just open the
specified file inside the already-open project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                *xcode-:Xswitch*
2.6 :Xswitch~

Switch the selected version of Xcode with `xcode-select`.

Different versions of Xcode contain different versions of Swift and different
versions of the compiler. Switching the version of Xcode can easily be done
outside of Vim with `xcode-select`, but it's useful to have a quick shortcut
for accessing that functionality quickly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *xcode-:Xworkspace*
2.7 :Xworkspace~

Set the workspace to build or test through `xcodebuild`.

Specify the workspace to build or test. Calling this command resets the
currently set SDK to build with, as well as the selected scheme. If you set a
workspace that doesn't exist, `xcodebuild` will throw an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               *xcode-:Xproject*
2.8 :Xproject~

Set the project to build or test through `xcodebuild`.

Specify the project to build or test. Calling this command resets the
currently set SDK to build with, as well as the selected scheme. If you set a
project that doesn't exist, `xcodebuild` will throw an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                *xcode-:Xscheme*
2.9 :Xscheme~

Set the scheme to build or test through `xcodebuild`.

Specify the scheme to build or test. Calling this command resets the currently
set SDK to build with. If you set a scheme that doesn't exist, `xcodebuild`
will throw an error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *xcode-:Xsimulator*
2.10 :Xsimulator~

Set the simulator to use for building/testing/running.

This will set the simulator to use for all commands while Xcode is running. It
will be reset to the default value (`"iPhone 6s"`) when Vim restarts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                *xcode-xcpretty*
2.11 xcpretty~

If `xcpretty`[1] is installed and is available in your `$PATH`, `xcode.vim`
will pipe all output through it to improve `xcodebuild`'s output. See
|xcode-Configuration| for info on how to customize the appearance of the
output.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION (3)                                          *xcode-Configuration*

You can configure `xcode.vim` with the following settings:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *xcode_runner_command*
3.1 g:xcode_runner_command~

The command to use when executing `xcodebuild` commands.

This is a template string used to execute the actual command. The string
"{cmd}" will be replaced with the actual `xcodebuild` command that has been
generated.

You can customize this if you want to pass the command through a custom script
in your `$PATH`, or use something like `vim-tmux-runner`[4] or
`vim-dispatch`[5] to make builds asynchronous

  let g:xcode_runner_command = 'VtrSendCommandToRunner! {cmd}'

Default: '! {cmd}`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *xcode_xcpretty_flags*
3.2 g:xcode_xcpretty_flags~

The flags to pass to `xcpretty`[1] for all actions, including tests.

See the `xcpretty` documentation[6] for available options.

  let g:xcode_xcpretty_flags = '--no-utf --color'

Default: '--color'

[6]: https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty#formats

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  *xcode_xcpretty_testing_flags*
3.3 g:xcode_xcpretty_testing_flags~

The flags to pass to `xcpretty`[1] for test actions only.

These will be combined with the flags from |xcode_xcpretty_flags| and
passed only to test actions. These are set separately because some flags, such
as '--test', hide the build output, which is probably undesirable during
normal build actions.

See the `xcpretty` documentation[6] for available options.

  let g:xcode_xcpretty_testing_flags = '--test'

Default: ''

[6]: https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty#formats

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *xcode_workspace_file*
3.4 g:xcode_workspace_file~

The main workspace to use for building and testing.

If `xcode.vim` routinely selects the wrong workspace, you can set this local
variable to tell it which to use. This is useful if you have multiple
workspaces at the root of your project directory and the one you would like to
default to isn't the first alphabetically.

If not set, `xcode.vim` will default to the first workspace file it finds
alphabetically.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            *xcode_project_file*
3.5 g:xcode_project_file~

The main project to use for building and testing.

If `xcode.vim` routinely selects the wrong project, you can set this local
variable to tell it which to use. This is useful if you have multiple projects
at the root of your project directory and the one you would like to default to
isn't the first alphabetically.

If not set, `xcode.vim` will default to the first project file it finds
alphabetically.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *xcode_default_scheme*
3.6 g:xcode_default_scheme~

The default scheme to use for building and testing.

If `xcode.vim` routinely selects the wrong scheme, you can set this local
variable to tell it which to use. This is useful if you have multiple schemes
in your project, and they are occasionally reordered.

If not set, `xcode.vim` will default to the first scheme listed as a result of
`xcodebuild -list`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       *xcode_default_simulator*
3.7 g:xcode_default_simulator~

The default simulator to use for building/testing/running.

If you'd like to make sure that you use a specific device by default every
time you build/run/test your iOS app, you can set this variable to do so.

If not set, `xcode.vim` will default to `"iPhone 6s"`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                   *xcode_default_configuration*
3.8 g:xcode_default_configuration~

The default build configuration to use for building/testing/running.

If you'd like to make sure that you use a specific build configuration by
default every time you build/run/test your iOS app, you can set this variable
to do so.

If not set, `xcode.vim` will default to `"Debug"`
