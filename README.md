# xcode.vim

Plugin for building and testing Xcode projects from within Vim


## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method check out
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
Plug 'gfontenot/vim-xcode'
```

## Usage

`xcode.vim` is a thin wrapper around `xcodebuild`, with some helper methods of
its own. It dynamically finds the project in the current working directory
(with support for workspaces as well) and builds the first scheme it finds.

 - `:Xbuild` will build the project
 - `:Xrun` will run the app in the iOS Simulator or locally on your Mac
 - `:Xtest` will test the project
 - `:Xclean` will clean the project's build directory
 - `:Xopen` will open the project or a specified file in Xcode
 - `:Xswitch` will switch the selected version of Xcode (requires sudo)
 - `:Xworkspace` will let you manually specify the workspace
 - `:Xproject` will let you manually specify the project
 - `:Xscheme` will let you manually specify the scheme
 - `:Xsimulator` will let you manually specify the simulator

### Default Configuration

If `xcode.vim` is having trouble determining the workspace/project/scheme to
use, you can set local variables to manually specify the configuration you
expect:

```
let g:xcode_workspace_file = 'path/to/workspace.xcworkspace'
let g:xcode_project_file = 'path/to/project.xcodeproj'
let g:xcode_default_scheme = 'MyScheme'
```

If setting a scheme for each project doesn't work for you,
you can set an ignore pattern to filter out schemes you don't
want to be selected by default.
```
let g:xcode_scheme_ignore_pattern = "/Demo|Example/d"
```

You can also specify a custom default simulator to use:

```
let g:xcode_default_simulator = 'iPhone 5'
```

Note that manually specifying a different value with any of the setter
commands listed above will override these values until you restart Vim.

This is most useful when placed inside a project-specific vimrc ([See the Argo
vimrc as an example][argo-vimrc]). You can make sure Vim loads these local
vimrc files by default by setting the following in your main vimrc:

[argo-vimrc]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo/blob/master/.vimrc

```
set secure  " Don't let external configs do scary shit
set exrc    " Load local vimrc if found
```

### `xcpretty` support

[`xcpretty`] is a gem for improving the output of xcodebuild. By default, if
you have it installed, `xcode.vim` will pipe all `xcodebuild` output through
`xcpretty` with the `--color` flag.

from within Vim).

### Async builds

By default, `xcode.vim` will take over the current terminal session to build
and display the build/test log. However, with long build times, this might not
be ideal. To help with this, `xcode.vim` allows you to customize the runner by
setting `g:xcode_runner_command`. This variable should be a template string,
where `{cmd}` will be replaced by the `xcodebuild` command.

```vim
let g:xcode_runner_command = 'VtrSendCommandToRunner! {cmd}'
```

This is useful for using `xcode.vim` with other plugins such as
[`vim-tmux-runner`] and [`vim-dispatch`].
